# Bolt12 Offer Decoding Library

WASM binding for the [Bolt12 Offer Decoding Library](https://github.com/21M4TW/b12od).

[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) needs to be installed to compile the
module. The module can be built using the wasm_binding target from the main
directory of the repository.

It can then be tested using

```python -m http.server 8080``` .
